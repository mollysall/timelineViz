SELECT substr(start, -4, 4) AS year, count(*)
FROM timelineNPS2
WHERE CAST(year as integer) < 2000 and CAST(year as integer) > 1900
GROUP BY year


this is just me messing with some sql statements and writing them down as i go

SELECT className
FROM timelineNPS2
GROUP BY className

SELECT substr(start, -4, 4) AS year, count(*), className
FROM timelineNPS2
WHERE CAST(year as integer) < 2000 and CAST(year as integer) > 1900
GROUP BY year, className
ORDER BY className, year

SELECT substr(start, -4, 4) AS year, count(*), substr(start, 0, 3) as month, className
FROM timelineNPS2
GROUP BY year, className, month
ORDER BY className, month, year
